                <h2>December 25th: Midweek Musings</h2>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's been about a month since my lowest point, and I'm glad to say that I've been feeling better and better with each passing day. Still waiting on the news regarding my credit situation from the school, but otherwise there hasn't been any major incidents that caused me to spiral downwards like before. I might not be happy, but I am content with my life so it's definitely an improvement. Since I'm writing this, I might try to use the website as a private journal of sorts, but I don't know if I would stick with it after New Year's.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm still kind of shocked at how fast December went by. It could be my age getting to me but I've stopped feeling the festivities of the New Year's arrival, it seems. We don't really celebrate Christmas either, so it's feeling like any other week of the year, other than the weather. Missing the sun already.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fitness is going well and not well. As in, I feel like I could be doing more: eating less, running more, resting properly and whatnot. But the bad weather combined with a general laziness has caused me to throw my end-of-the-year goals out the window. I've still got a target to hit in mind for January 1st and I'll probably hit it (barring anything major happening within the next week), but it's much more of a realistic goal than the one I set for myself three months ago.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah well. Those are the games we play with ourselves I guess.</p>

                <h3>Book Progress</h3>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently reading through Rhythm of War, the fourth book in the Stormlight Archive series. Still debating whether or not I should finish the fourth and the fifth book before I start another series, as the fifth book released rather recently and I'm scared of stumbling into spoilers while I'm on the internet.</p>
